    &nbsp;The Equivalency Matrix is designed to be a resource to identify
    potential transfer credit and associated University of Belize course
    equivalents from completed coursework at other academic institutions. This
    database is provided as a service for students wanting to know whether the
    course(s) they are taking or plan to take will transfer to the University of
    Belize. The database is for reference only and is continually being updated
    as new courses are evaluated. It is neither an official determination nor a
    guarantee of transfer credit equivalencies. All information contained within
    this Matrix is subject to change, without prior notification. Final course
    equivalency is determined by the university's academic departments.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 text-center">
    &nbsp;Courses not appearing in the Matrix may transfer, but most likely have
    not been evaluated yet. Current UB students desiring an evaluation of
    courses not appearing in the Matrix should follow up with the Records
    Office. Credits for college-level courses must be completed with a grade of
    "C" (2.0) or better.
